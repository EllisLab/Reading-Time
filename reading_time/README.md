# Reading Time

The Reading Time plugin lets you output an estimated reading time for a given bit of content.

> You can read this in about 3 minutes

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EllisLab/Reading-Time/releases/latest).
2. Copy the `reading_time` folder to your `system/user/addons` folder (you can ignore the rest of this repository's files).
3. In your ExpressionEngine control panel, visit the Add-On Manager and click Install next to "Reading Time".

## Usage

### `{exp:reading_time}`

This is the Reading Time's only tag, it is used as follows.

#### Example Usage

```
{exp:reading_time}
    {exp:channel:entries channel="blog"}
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <p>You can read this {finished_reading_time:relative}.</p>

        {content}
    {/exp:channel:entries}
{/exp:reading_time}
```

#### Parameters

- `wpm` - Words per minute. _default: 200_

#### Variables

##### {finished_reading_time}

Timestamp that the visitor will be finished reading the content. This variable is an [ExpressionEngine date variable](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/templates/date_variable_formatting.html) which provides immense flexibility in output. For example, you can output the time they'll be finished:

    You'll be done reading at {finished_reading_time format="%h:%i%a"}.
    <!-- You'll be done reading at 12:41pm -->

Or a relative time:

    You can read this {finished_reading_time:relative}.
    <!-- You can read this in 3 minutes. -->

[Relative dates](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/templates/date_variable_formatting.html#relative-dates) allow you to customize the output quite a bit:

    You can read this {finished_reading_time:relative depth="2"}.
    <!-- You can read this in 6 minutes and 57 seconds. -->

Or even:

    You'll know how to make {recipe_title} {finished_reading_time:relative future="%s from now"}!
    <!-- You'll know how to make Beef Bourguignonne 12 minutes from now! -->
